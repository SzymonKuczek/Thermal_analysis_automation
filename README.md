# Thermal Bridge Automation Tool 🏗️🌡️



An engineering automation tool written in Python designed to calculate the U-value (thermal transmittance) and visualize temperature distribution in multi-layer building partitions.



# 🚀 Key Features

- **Symbolic Calculation:** Uses `SymPy` to dynamically derive physical equations for any number of layers, eliminating manual formula errors.

- **Automated Reporting:** Reads geometry and material data from Excel files (`openpyxl`) and generates visual plots automatically.

- **Visualization:** Generates temperature gradient charts using `Matplotlib` to identify potential freezing points inside the structural wall.

- **Batch Processing:** Capable of processing hundreds of project files simultaneously in a single run.



# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**

- **SymPy**(Symbolic mathematics \& physics formulas)

- **Matplotlib**(Data visualization)

- **OpenPyXL** (Excel data integration)

# 📊 Example Results

1. Passive House Standard (U = 0.12 W/m²K)

The structural layer remains in the positive temperature zone (approx. +19°C).



2. Uninsulated Brick Wall (U = 1.25 W/m²K)

Rapid temperature drop across the entire structure, high risk of freezing.



# 🔧 How to Run
